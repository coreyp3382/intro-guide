##__ABSTRACT__##
  WWII is considered to be the greatest conflict in human history.  The conflict raged across Europe, Asia, Southeast Asia, and islands in the Pacific.  The War began on September 1st, 1939 and ended on September 2nd, 1945.  58 countries took part in the conflict that cost 60 million lives. Due to the large size of the conflict, various historians have portrayed the battles and campaigns of WWII in a variety of ways with different sources of information. Putting all of these different sources of information together sometimes leads to several versions of the same battle but with different information being presented which could make it difficult to find out what actually happened.

  The purpose of this paper is to look at the various authors and source that discuss the battles and discern what actually took place, who was there, and what is/isn't true.  The sources used in this paper come from books written by Osprey Publishing.  The books focus on a particular campaign or battle and discuss them in great detail with historical accuracy, eyewitness accounts, photos, maps, full color battle scenes, 3-dimensional bird's-eye-view, and illustrations that can make you feel like you were right there with the soldiers.  For example, one book is called __LEYTE 1944__ Return to the Philippines.  The book was written by Clayton Chun, and Illustrated by Giuseppe Rava.  The book follows General MacArthur's return to the Philippines and the liberation of Leyte Island from the Japanese which was the start of the Liberation of the Philippine Islands.

##__LUZON 1945__##
  Another book written by Chun is __LUZON 1945__.  The book is about the final liberation of the Philippines following the successful capture of Leyte in November, 1944.  The forces used by the U.S. during the Allied invasion and subsequent Luzon campaign was largely an all-American Army show.  The U.S. Sixth Army was the primary US force on Luzon with 5 infantry divisions (6th, 43rd, 25th, 37th, and 40th), three Regimental Combat Teams (63rd, 158th, and 108th), the 13th Armored Group, the 68th Antiaircraft Artillery Brigade, the 6th Ranger Battalion, and support elements.  The Japanese had 262 thousand men defending Luzon, but the Americans had the edge with superior equipment, training, tactics, and firepower.  An unsung Allied force that provided significant combat, reconnaissance, intelligence, scouting, and other support was the Filipino guerrilla movement.
  One of General MacArthur's justifications for invading Luzon, instead of Formosa, was to rescue the many American and Filipino prisoners languishing in Japanese camps.  Since the fall of the Philippines in 1942, most American POWs had been shipped out of the Philippines and sent to labor camps in Japan, but large numbers remained.  The Allied planners feared that the Japanese would kill the prisoners rather than release them if American troops got close.  This was true on the Island of Palawan where 150 American POWs were herded into air raid shelters and burnt alive upon the news of MacArthur's invasion of the Philippines.  The POW camp at Cabanatuan was the first POW camp rescue during the campaign.  The raid was done by the 6th Ranger Battalion, and 286 Filipino guerrillas and they rescued 512 POWs for the loss of two rangers killed and one wounded.  It is considered to be one of the greatest rescue missions ever conduct in the history of the U.S. military.

##__CHERBOURG 1944__##
  One major wrier in Osprey Publishing is Steven Zaloga.  Steven J. Zaloga received his BA in History from Union College and his MA from Columbia University. He is the author of numerous books on military technology and military history, with an accent on the US Army in WWII as well as Russia and the former Soviet Union.  4 of the 6 books discussed in this essay are written by him.  The first book discussed in this essay is __CHERBOURG 1944__.  It was the first Allied victory in Normandy following D-Day.  The US VII Crops was tasked with securing the Cotentin Peninsula and the port city of Cherbourg.  The German units were mainly coastal defense troops with a wide assortment of equipment.  The division at the center of Cherbourg's defense was the 709th Infantry Division, a static division used for occupational duties and coastal defense.
  There were only two German Panzer (tank) units on the Cotentin Peninsula on D-Day, both replacement and training battalions (__Panzer-Ersatz-und-Ausbildung-Abteilungen__), equipped mainly with war-booty French tanks of the 1940 campaign.  Panzer Replacement and Training Battalion 100 was equipped with 17 Renault R-35 light tanks, 8 Hotchkiss H-39 light tanks, one Somua S-35 medium tank, one Char B1 Bis heavy tank, and one Panzer III J medium tank. Panzer Replacement and Training Battalion 206 was equipped with 20 Hotchkiss H-39s, ten Somua S-35s, two Renault R-35s, and six Char B1 Bis.  These French tanks had good armor protection by 1940 standards but were vulnerable to all typically U.S. Army anti-tank weapons of the 1944 period.  There was also plenty of Russian Artillery guns but the fighting power of the Wehrmacht on the peninsula was hampered by lingering shortages of good quality troops.  General Marcks summed up his opinion during the Cherbourg maneuvers in 1944: "Emplacements without guns, ammunition depots without ammunition, minefields without mines, and a large number of men in uniform with hardly a soldier among them." (CHERBOURG, 13)

##__BRITTANY 1944__##
  The Second book is __BRITTANY 1944__.  The book is about Hitler's Final Defenses in France.  The main focus of the book is the Siege of Brest.  Apart from the Americans, the French resistance played an active role during the campign.  The French resistance movement had a much greater impact in Brittany during the 1944 campaign than in most other regions.  This was due to the unique conditions in the region along with a very active Allied special operations effort.  The first large-scale Allied support for the Breton Maquis started in June, 1944, with the dispatch of the troops of 4 SAS.  The Allies would liberate Brest September 15, 1944, but the Germans so severely damaged the port facilities that it would not be until after the war that the port was operational.  Following the capture of Brest, it was decided to contain the remaining Breton ports.  With most of France liberated, de Gaulle's provisional government had to decide on the future of the FFI (French Forces of the Interior also known as the French Resistance).  By August, 1944, the FFI was estimated to number 400,000, although not all were armed.  the FFI was a collection of local militias; some politically motivated, others more patriotically motivated.  De Gaulle's government was aware that some of the more belligerent Maquis were those of the French communist party and there was concern over the future political intentions.
  Regardless of the political threat, the immediate problem was the growing lawlessness in some areas, with the Maquis conducting retribution against collaborators.  Order was needed to be established or a civil war might ensue.  The solution was two-fold.  On the one hand, the 1st French Army in Alsace needed reinforcements.  This army had been raised from North African and West African colonial units, many of which had been in combat since early 1943.  De Gaulle felt it was politically necessary to replace as many colonial troops as possible with Frenchmen.  As a result, many FFI members were given a choice of being absorbed into the army or being disarmed and sent home.  About 300,000 FFI members went to the army, and a further 40,000 to the French air force and navy.  The FFI helped in creating three new divisions that could be employed to cordon the ports.  These units were equipped with older war-booty French equipment from 1940 still stored in German depots; some equipment such as tanks came from captured German equipment.

##__ST LO 1944__##
The Third book is __ST LO 1944__.  The book is about the Liberation of St Lo, France, and the battle for the hedgerows.  The US First Army was hampered in their campaign to liberate ST LO.  The terrain at the base of the Cotentin peninsula was tightly compartmentalized by *bocage*, the French term for coastal hedgerows.  The situation was exacerbated by the sodden marshlands feeding into the Vire River estuary and numerous other rivers in the area.  The marshlands were swollen by late June rain and some of the areas had been dammed and flooded by the German army to repel Allied airborne landings.  The conditions in the bocage country were well known to the commander, GFM Erwin Rommel, who had fought in the area during the 1940 Battle of France.  The Germans recognized the defensive advantages of the bocage country, and so concentrated their limited forces, especially their premier Panzer divisions, in facing the British.  The fighting in the bocage country was conducted primarily by infantry forces on both sides.  The one area of unquestioned U.S. Army superiority in Normandy was in field artillery.  Artillery was the primary killing arm on the World War II battlefield, accounting for the majority of enemy casualties.  U.S. and German artillery composition at divisional level was similar on paper, the U.S. infantry division having three 105mm howitzer battalions and one 155mm howitzer battalion.  However, U.S. units had their full equipment sets while German divisions in Normandy often had substitutes, such as war-booty equipment.  The German 7th Army had about 350 guns and howitzers in its field artillery battalions compared to about 1,200 in the First U.S. Army.  Aside from the disparity in numbers, the German arsenal was an incredibly motely selection numbering 19 different types of which only half, about 190 guns, were standard 105mm IFH 18/40 and 150mm sFH 18 divisional guns.  The rest were expedient types including over 110 war-booty Soviet, French, and Italian guns.  
  *Bocage* is the Norman and French name for the style of terrain found in the western area of Lower Normandy consisting of pastures boxed in by hedgerows.  From a military perspective, the hedgerows created a network of inverted trenches, forming a natural, layered fortification system that was well suited for defense.  The earthen bases of the hedgerows shielded the defender from enemy fire and were thick enough to protect against small arms and machine-gun fire.  The vegetation on top of the hedgerow provided concealment for the defenders and restricted the observation of the attacking force. *Bocage* complicated the use of field artillery since the vegetation could prematurely detonate the artillery rounds in the trees above before their intended impact against enemy positions.  In addition, the hedgerows provided a solid basis for foxholes to shield against mortar and artillery fire.

##__DOWNFALL 1945__##
  The Fourth book is __DOWNFALL 1945__.  The book is about the fall of Hitler's Third Reich.  By 1945, the Nazi scheme to dominate Europe had failed.  It was no longer a matter whether Germany would be defeated, but a matter of when.  The final Soviet assault of Berlin began on April 14, 1945 and concluded in early May 1945.  Hitler committed suicide in his command bunker in Berlin on April 30, and the military government under Admiral Donitz brought the war to a close on May 8-9.  Fighting continued for more than a week including a major campaign in Prague.  This book focuses on the central fronts in Germany during the final month of the war in Europe in April-May 1945.  Of the 60 million people who died in the war Russia has the honor of most lives lost with 26 million dead.

  By the spring on 1945, the conflicting war aims of the Soviet Union and its Anglo-American allies were coming into sharper focus.  The coalition that had so successfully prosecuted the war against Germany lasted only a few years before degenerating in a half-century of Cold War. The grim memories of the grotesque violence of 1945 helped dissuade the new rivals from ever letting the Cold War turn hot.  Germany would be at the center of the Cold War divided by the UN and USSR with West and East Germany, respectively.  It would not be until, 1990 that Germany would become a unified nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
  
##__CONCLUSION__##

  The war began on September 1st, 1939 and ended September 2nd, 1945.  The war lasted six years a one day before peace was restored to the world.  The Allies initially planned for invaded the Japanese home islands in Operation Downfall.  The invasion would commence in 1946, but certain outcomes changed the plans altogether.  The severe loss of American troops on the islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa made Allied leaders seek alternatives to invading Japan.  The Japanese fought with such determination on the two islands that it was portents of what would be expected if the Allies invaded Japan itself.  The atomic testing at Trinity provided the Americans with the ultimate alternative to wasting tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers and marines.  Following the first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, the Soviet Union launched their invasion of Manchuria.  The last battles of WWII took place in that region.  The battles were a strange mixture of old and new – horsed cavalry fought alongside modern tanks and armoured trains went into action for almost the last time.  In another, more sinister way they were the shape of things to come.  Suicidal attacks on Soviet tanks by infantry using demolition charges, anti-tank grenades and lunge mines.  Soviet accounts of these attacks in the Manchurian campaign provide a chilling foretaste of the suicide bombers of the 21st century.  
  World War II was so large of a conflict that conflicts in the 21st century use the weapons of WWII including small-arms, heavy weapons, and vehicles.  Tanks like the Soviet T-34 would be seen in countries like Jordan and Syria still in service.  The Sherman tanks were used by Israel until the mid-1970s and were customized by Israel to have more armour and a better gun.  German Panzer IV medium tanks and Jagdpanzer (tank-hunter) IV tank destroyers were used by Syria in the Six Day Arab-Israeli War. The Six Day War was the last time that German Panzers were used in war.  Its ironic that they would face off against Sherman tanks in the desert but this time it would be the Sherman’s that have the edge in armour and firepower.  Over the decades, historians have written many different versions of WWII.  Some sources just skim over the war and focus on important battles or other areas of the conflict like the home front, the politics, or the Holocaust.  Other sources go into detail on the campaigns and battles including eyewitness accounts, quotes, maps, concept art, photos, and much more.  Osprey Publishing is part of the latter.  They also write books on the vehicles in the war from airplanes, to tanks and other armored fighting vehicles to warships, the fortifications, the troops with their uniforms and gear, and more.  They also do other conflicts beside WWII such as the War of Spanish Succession, the conquests of Rome and Charlemagne, the famous battles like Zama, Waterloo and others, and even modern conflicts.  The way that WWII is portrayed is as varied as the historians who study the war.
